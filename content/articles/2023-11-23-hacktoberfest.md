**It’s been nearly a month since EPAM colleagues across the globe coded, reviewed and waited for any last minute merges for their contributions into Hacktoberfest 2023; a global initiative to encourage open source contribution into projects and solutions that both EPAM and our clients depend upon – in this article we celebrate those who got stuck in as well as share some impressive stories behind the contributions.**

## Who were the contributors?

We were amazed at the number of contributions made throughout Hacktoberfest 2023 and wanted to recognize the Top 10 Contributors from across the globe.
These individuals, who each received one of our top prizes, were as follows:

Jane Doe, **Oleksandr Redko**, John Smith, Maria Garcia, Ahmed Khan, Priya Patel, Carlos Hernandez, Yuki Tanaka, Fatima Al-Mansouri.

Additionally, we should also thank and congratulate each of our other contributors who supported the initiative and received prizes for their engagement.

## Finally, did we mention trees?

As part of the ever-growing, and incredibly important, relationship between open source and sustainability it’s a fantastic pleasure to share that individuals who contributed not just to EPAM’s Hacktoberfest engagement, but were also amongst the first 50,000 participants to have their contributions accepted to the global initiative, have had a tree planted in their name through Hacktoberfest partner Tree Nation.

We can’t wait for Hacktoberfest 2024 and would like to invite anyone who is interested in finding out how to support to get in touch.
