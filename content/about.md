{{< img src="/img/about/photo-redko.webp" width="400" title="Oleksandr Redko" >}}

I'm a backend software engineer with more than 10 years of commercial experience and technical education. [Go](../tags/go) is my primary programming language, and I'm also proficient in Python with solid experience in C++, PowerShell, and C#.

I focus on improving processes and workflows around CI/CD, code analysis, and linting.

I have worked with both microservices and monolithic architectures deployed in the cloud and on-premises. I'm passionate about [Open Source](https://github.com/alexandear/alexandear/blob/main/CONTRIBUTIONS.md) contributions.

## My History

I'm addicted to programming. Every day I write code, watch tech videos, or read computer articles and books. Is it passion or sickness?

This was not always the case. When I was in school, I typed words from Pascal programs but didn't understand what "while", "for", "else", or semicolons meant. I couldn't solve even a simple algorithm task. At Shevchenko University, I got a poor score in Programming and the examiner told me I would never become a software developer. It bothered me.

The next year, I pivoted and started studying Computer Science at the National Technical University of Ukraine "Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute". I learned higher mathematics, algorithms, relational databases, design patterns, monolithic applications, and systems design, all with passion and enthusiasm. In my third year of study, I fell in love with C++ and it became my main programming language for the following 4 years. Since then, I have consumed plenty of blog posts about concurrency, data structures, unit tests, and CI/CD; read books about OOP, SOLID, and clean code; and attended dozens of tech conferences.

Once upon a time, I heard about Nimses. This startup developed a worldwide system that records the time of a human being's life. Its idea excited me so much that I left my C++ position and started working on this system. Many things used in the project were new to me and I learned them from scratch: Go, microservices in the cloud, NoSQL databases, and Docker.

So, writing code is neither passion nor sickness. It's a habit that I have developed over a lifetime.
