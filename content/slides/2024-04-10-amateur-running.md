This lecture was given in Ukrainian to 200 colleagues at EPAM company.
I discussed the difference between amateur and professional running, whether running can help you lose weight, and how much to run when preparing for different distances.
I also covered the changes you will experience after taking up running, the best weather and time of day for running, and whether it is beneficial to run every day.
Additionally, I explored why people run in the mountains, what you need to start running, what you can learn from running besides running itself, and where to find running communities in your city.
